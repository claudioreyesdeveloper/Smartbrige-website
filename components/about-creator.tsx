              Claudio is a long-time Yamaha keyboard player and arranger. After years of performing with Tyros and
              Genos, he grew tired of navigating menus instead of making music.
            </p>

            <p>When he couldn't find a plugin that offered complete 32-channel control, he built one himself.</p>

            <p>SmartBridge began as a tool for personal use â€” but has grown into something worth sharing.</p>

            <p className="italic text-muted-foreground border-l-2 border-primary pl-4">
              "I'm not a professional developer," Claudio says, "just a musician who wanted my instruments to feel
              faster, freer, and more musical."
